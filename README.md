# Machine learning course at University of Pavia

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites for the course include basic knowledge of GitHub, Colab and python. It is thus required before the course to go through [these](https://github.com/jngadiub/ML_course_Pavia_23/blob/main/python_basics/prerequisites.pdf) slides as well as the two python basics notebooks: 

* [`python_intro_part1.ipynb`](https://github.com/jngadiub/ML_course_Pavia_23/blob/main/python_basics/python_intro_part1.ipynb)
* [`python_intro_part2.ipynb`](https://github.com/jngadiub/ML_course_Pavia_23/blob/main/python_basics/python_intro_part2.ipynb)
